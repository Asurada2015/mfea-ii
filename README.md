# Multi-Factorial Evolutionary Algorithm With Online Transfer Parameter Estimation (MFEA-II) in Python

This repository implement MFEA-II [MFEA-II Official Matlab Version](http://www.bdsc.site/websites/MTO/MFEA2.zip). Tested on MTSOO benchmark. This repo could be used as a template or starter code for conducting multitasking optimization on other specific problems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This is a pure Numpy/Scipy implementation. Install necessary library using

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example

Run a sample test with
```
python3 run.py
```
